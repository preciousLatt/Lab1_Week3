Singleton lab

A tiny Unity game where you collect a single coin, avoid red blocks, and reach the blue block to win. Thia demonstrates how to incorporate a Singleton via an Audio Manager so that when the Player - a capsule tagged "Player" collides with the coin, a pickup sound plays.

Win the game by reaching the blue block. If timer hits zero or if player collides with red block - you lose. 

Best of luck, player.
